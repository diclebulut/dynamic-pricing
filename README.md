# dynamic-pricing

In this repository, I take dynamic pricing methods from other sources and apply them to publicly available Uber Rides data, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/dynamic-pricing-dataset?resource=download

I adapt code from different resources to this data, which enables me to review the outputs in a singular business context rather than generated samples or a different type of pricing data. Using the same data for different techniques is useful in terms of comparing outputs and processes.
